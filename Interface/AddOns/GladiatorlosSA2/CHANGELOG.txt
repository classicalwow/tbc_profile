NOTE: GSA2 for TBC is designed with Spell Ranks in mind. ALL spell ranks are included on most spells, excluding
lower ranks specific abilities that don't get an alert-worthy secondary effect (like CC) until the later ranks.

If you are observant enough to notice a spell that might be missing a few ranks, please let me know.
