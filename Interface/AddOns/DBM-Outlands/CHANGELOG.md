[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-TBC-Classic/compare/2.5.26...2.5.27) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-TBC-Classic/releases)

- Prep new tags  
- Bump Classic TOC version to 1.14.2  
- Fixed Auto expand defaults for retail Tweaked Panel prototype to reduce unnessesary calls to getspellinfo by using the already existing check in main gui file Also added a check that if blank or no description, insert a text saying there isn't one so it isn't just an empty box  
- ContinueOnSpellLoad fails horribly if the spellid used is not actually a valid one (might be cause if loading a PTR mod on retail or blizzard deletes/changes a spellId. Fixed by adding validation and if not valid it'll revert to just setting text as text  
- Fixed a bug where mother didn't show what icons are used on FA option  
- spell grouping fixes  
- Update commonlocal.ru.lua (#76)  
- Port minor fix for chromaggus  
- Because of alpha users, this needs to be forced, or it'll look bad in classic and tbc  
- Make it so classic and tbc auto expand options grouped by spell, since in many cases spells in tbc and earlier didn't even have descriptions/tooltips in first place. Made it so auto grouping is the default for allmods, and instead specific mods it's just not a good idea for can turn it off Also made remaining checks more robust with nil checks Lastly, added a new common local that will be used pretty often in classic era to show which options only apply to seasonal realms.

- Fix some cases of text not being centered.  
- Update localization.cn.lua (#102)
