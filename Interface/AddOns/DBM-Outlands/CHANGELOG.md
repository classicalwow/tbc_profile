- Update koKR (#35)  
- Also update common locals  
- Kill off short text option and just make it the norm, eliminating a lot of duplication  
- Fix potential bugs with last  
- Added support for extending the icon setting api. This allows advaned users to enable usage of up to 16 raid icons if they add a custom texture file to game.  
    Important Notes:  
    1. Even if you install custom texture and enable option, others won't SEE icons unless they also install texture (they don't need to enable extended option in DBM if they aren't setting any icons though  
    2. icons set on players using icons 9-16 will not appear over players or creatures heads. They only appear on nameplates and raid/target/unit frames  
    3, Icons will not work in SAY messages so they will not be used there.  
- Prep next alpha cycles
